# Church Website UI Template

## Project Overview

This project is a **Church Website UI Template** built with HTML and CSS Grid, designed to create a welcoming and informative online presence for a church. The layout features a home page with sections for services, sermons, church events, and contact information, all organized in a clean and responsive grid-based design. This template can be easily customized for any church or religious organization.

## Features

- **Responsive Grid Layout**: The website uses CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Home Page Sections**: Includes sections for church services, recent sermons, upcoming events, and a contact form.
- **Modern, Minimalist Design**: Clean, elegant UI with modern CSS styling to ensure the site is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **Customizable Layout**: Easily modify content and images to reflect the specific needs of any church or religious organization.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Contains the HTML structure of the church website.
- `styles.css` - Handles the layout and styling of the website using CSS Grid and additional CSS features for a polished design.

## How It Works

- **HTML Structure**: The main content is structured with semantic HTML elements, such as sections for the church's mission, services, events, and contact form. Each section is placed within a grid container to allow for a flexible and responsive design.
- **CSS Grid Layout**: The CSS Grid layout organizes the sections into neat rows and columns, allowing for a dynamic and adaptable design that works on different screen sizes.
